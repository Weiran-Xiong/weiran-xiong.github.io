<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Weiran Xiong, an M.Phil. student in Applied Mathematics at the [Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems](https://iics.fudan.edu.cn/_s599/ywb/main.psp), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). 

I am delighted to study and conduct my research under the supervision of Prof. [Yunzhang Li](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/li_yunzhang/zh_CN/index/665374/list/index.htm), and with the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm). Before that, I earned a dual B.S. degree in Mathematics and Economics from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), graduating with honors from a Specialized Class jointly cultivated by the School of Mathematics and the School of Economics.

My research interests include:
- Mathematical Finance
- Stochastic Control and Games
- Numerical Method and Simulation
- Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning

I have a strong interest in interdisciplinary research, particularly at the intersection of Mathematics, Data Science, and Finance. I am currently exploring and establishing my own research direction. If you are interested in any aspect of me, feel free to reach out for chats, discussions, and collaborations!
